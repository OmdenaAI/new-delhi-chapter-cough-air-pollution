# Task Folder Details

Note : Please Follow the below guidelines to create task folders
- Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
- All Task folder names should be in chronologial order (from 1 to n)
- All Task folders should have a README.md file with task Details and task goals along with an info table containing all code/notebook files with their links and information
- Task folders that contain sub-tasks can create sub folders within the task.
- __Update the below table explaining the task details.__

### Task Table

| Task No| Task Name | Details |
|-|-|-|
|1|         |         |
|2|         |         |

|4|Model Development|Model_5_data_prep :- Preparaing EC50 data for detecting whether audio has cough or not|
|4|Model Development|Model_5 :- Model training to find out the best model for Cough Audio Detection using EC50 data|
|4|Model Development|Model_6_data_prep :- Preparaing data from respiratory sound dataset for cough severity detection|

|4|Model Development|simple_models_coughvid :- Earlier Version of Model 1|
|5|Political Rationale| The entire basis of the political rationale is to create a document upon which we could use as a basis to know if the direction of our current application is viable or not|
